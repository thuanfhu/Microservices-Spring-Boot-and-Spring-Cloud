If you're not ready to provide feedback at that point, you can choose to skip it, as Udemy will prompt you for feedback at various stages throughout the course. You can share your valuable insights when you feel prepared to do so.</p><h4> DON'T HURRY</h4><p>I recommend setting a realistic schedule for yourself, perhaps dedicating a certain amount of time each day to the course. This way, you'll not only learn more effectively but also have a more enjoyable learning experience. Remember, learning is a journey, not a race. Take your time and don't try to rush yourself to complete the course in a couple of days or a week.</p><h4> FOLLOW ME</h4><p>You can follow eazybytes on LinkedIn for regular updates on my courses and other new trends etc. Please use the below link to follow,</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/eazybytes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>LinkedIn</strong></a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Thank you so much!
